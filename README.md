## DSC Hoa Sen Malware (Sort of)
### Introduction 
Malware is a interesting topic, because the nature of it. The core of it is just a program but student and nontech people think it like a black box of magic created by a dark wizard of Mordor, which will destroy their computer magically. To be honest I'm just a student whose major is Computer Network so my coding skill is not good, but I read a lot of book about virus and malware (The Art of Computer Virus Research And Defense, Pratical Malware Analysis, ...)
So I decided to create this to demonstrate to DSC Hoa Sen that anyone could write a Malware if they had that bad intention, how to defense against them, show them with only the write file and read file they use as school for project like Student Management, ... could be use for such way like this
